    <h3>Offers & Promotions</h3>
        <p id="details">
            <b>Collect 10 Stamps:</b>
            <br>
            Learn from coffee shops, and give cards to members that get stamped every time they attend.
            If they visit 10 times during the month, then reward them with a free class, PT session, or swag. Consistent attendance in the first month is linked to longer retention, so incentivise them to make exercise a habit!</br>
            <b>Referrals On Demand:</b><br>
            Take full advantage by making it easy for members to refer others.
            One way to do this is by creating online vouchers that are free to access, so people can share them with friends and family… Offer a variety to appeal to different types of people and interests, such as a Swim & Sauna Day For 2, Group PT Session, or PT Starter Class Pass.</br>
            <b>De-Stress:</b><br>
            Promote all your wonderful de-stressing services. Remind existing members about your sauna, spa, and pool facilities. Encourage them to try your yoga, Pilates, or Tai Chi classes.  Hold free relaxation workshops to attract new members and create a ‘de-stress’ package to offer them at the end.</br>
            <b>Summer Body:</b><br>
            Unless you’re in the southern hemisphere, May is the ideal time to begin your ‘summer body’ themed promos. Starting at this time gives people enough time to actually see results before their beach break. Offering 6-8 week transformation challenges is a proven way to get existing members re-engaged and attract new members to sign up.</br>
            <b>Fresh Fruit Flyers:</b><br>
            Stop handing out flyers and hand out fruit instead! Head down to a busy area that’s within walking distance of your club, and give out fruits with complimentary passes tied to them. Strawberries, peaches, melon, blueberries, passion fruit, cherries, and pineapple are all in season during June, which means they’ll be cheap to get and irresistible to passers-by.</br>
