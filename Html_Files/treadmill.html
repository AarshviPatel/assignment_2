               The SOLE Treadmill Desk allows the user to walk at their own pace while working. With 3 quick speed controls, you can be as productive with your exercise as you are with your work! Get out of your desk chair and work your way toward greater energy and improved health.
A sedentary lifestyle is contributing to more cases of heart disease than ever before, and an estimated one half of the North American population will be clinically obese by the next generation. The most effective way to counteract the harmful effects of prolonged sitting is to add more movement to your day. The SOLE Fitness treadmill desk offers an easy and reliable solution to help you stay active while at work!
The SOLE Treadmill Desk desktop and frame easily fold to free up space when not in use. Other features of the Treadmill Desk include a large desktop workspace, safety clip, start speeds from only 0.5 mph, and a low-profile running hood.
The Treadmill Desk console can be attached anywhere along the desktop and is user-friendly with a vibrant display showing feedback about Time, Speed, Distance, Calories, Scan, Step, Stride, Mute.
Purchase of the SOLE Fitness Treadmill Desk includes premium threshold delivery meaning your treadmill is delivered directly to the first dry area of your home: inside your front door, garage, or inside the front lobby of your building, and will not be left on your curb.
