              The Endurance by Body-Solid R300 Indoor Rower delivers an effective low-impact cardio and total body workout.
                Not only does the rowing movement provide users with high-intensity calorie-burning cardio but works
                quadriceps, hamstrings, abdominals, obliques, lats, biceps, triceps, hip flexors and more. User-controlled
                air resistance puts users in full control for a balanced and coordinated workout. The R300 is a
                self-generating machine eliminating power requirements for peak energy efficiency in home or commercial
                settings. A precision-engineered flywheel design minimizes noise. Nickel-plated chain offers unmatched
                durability in even the most intense environments.  A textured, ergonomic handle allows users to row with
                natural hand and arm positions while fully-adjustable footrests provide users a safe and comfortable
                workout on the R300 Indoor Rower. A convenient cell phone holder can be used for both entertaining
                and workout tracking purposes.  The interactive console reports on time, heart rate, calories,
                paddle width, stroke rate, distance cycle and watts and is Polar compatible.  8 different exercise
                programs -Quick Start, Distance, Time, Calories, Game, Intervals (20/10. 10/20. 10/10) -
                are also built into the console.  Ideal for home, commercial and group workout settings.
                Rowers have seen a resurgence of popularity in recent years driven in part by their usage in
                cross fit and other hot exercise programs.  Pair this with our other cross fit oriented product
                like our FB300 Fan Bike and our new Power Racks and Half Racks to satisfy the needs of any training
                facility.  Push your body to the absolute limit with intense movements designed to test your cardio
                endurance and provide unmatched upper body engagement.
