        	The Northern Lights Squat Stands provides you with a sturdy and functional set-up that allows you to progressively increase your strength and power training by giving you a solid work station. The squat stand is well suited for home gyms and features easy height transitions from 49" to 75" (3" hole spacing)
		The 75" height gives you ample space for your workout routine under an 8-foot ceiling, while a compact footprint of just 16"x18‚Äù per stand leaves you with plenty of room for gym additions and customization. Designed with space in mind, these stands allow users to perform squat exercises even when space is limited!
